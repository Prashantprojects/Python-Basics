**Assignment Python Basics, Conditional Loops:**
1. Write a program which wil find all such numbers which are divisble by 7 but are not a mulitple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-seperated sequance on a single line

3. Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user.
input word: Prashant\
Output: tnahsarP

** Assignment Tuples, set **
1.1 Write a Python Program to implement your own myreduce() function which works exactly like Python's built-in function reduce()
1.2 Write a Python program to implement your own myfilter() function which works exactly like Python's built in function filter()
2  Implement List comprehensions to produce the following lists.

['x', 'xx', 'xxx', 'xxxx', 'y', 'yy', 'yyy', 'yyyy', 'z', 'zz', 'zzz', 'zzzz'] \
['x', 'y', 'z', 'xx', 'yy', 'zz', 'xx', 'yy', 'zz', 'xxxx', 'yyyy', 'zzzz']\
[[2], [3], [4], [3], [4], [5], [4], [5], [6],[[2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 6],\
[4, 5, 6, 7], [5, 6, 7, 8]] \
[(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]
